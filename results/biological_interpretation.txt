🧬 BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF MODEL

The machine learning model learned that these molecular properties are most important
for predicting drug potency against Dopamine D2 receptor:

1. Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA):
   - Predicts drug's ability to cross membranes
   - Lower TPSA = better cell penetration
   - Sweet spot: 20-130 Ų for drugs

2. Molecular Weight (MW):
   - Heavy molecules = poor absorption
   - Sweet spot: 160-480 g/mol for drugs
   - Below 400 g/mol preferred

3. Lipophilicity (LogP):
   - Controls membrane crossing
   - Sweet spot: 2-5 for optimal drugs
   - Too high = solubility issues
   - Too low = poor cell penetration

This aligns with Lipinski's Rule of Five - pharmaceutical standards for orally active drugs!

🎯 MODEL CONCLUSION:
The model predicts that drugs with:
✓ Low TPSA (<130)
✓ Medium MW (160-400)
✓ Balanced lipophilicity (LogP 2-5)
✓ Fewer rotatable bonds

...will be MORE POTENT against Dopamine D2 receptor.

This knowledge can help in designing new drug candidates!
